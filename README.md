# Differentiation
Install:
```
make
```
Use this format to write formula:
```
<formula> [at <point>]
```
For example, if you want to calculate it at point:
```
sin(5*x) at 3.14
```
and otherwise:
```
x^x
```
## Features
1. Slight simplification of expressions.
2. Use of named constants in the analytical calculation of derivatives.

**Not supported**:
1. Named constants for calculating the derivative at a point.
2. Complicated expression simplifications.
